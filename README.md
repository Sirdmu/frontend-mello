This project is called "Mello" and here we essentially clone the "Trello" app.  This specific app is a front-end static version of the app and does not communicate with a databse which I will refer to as Version1.  

  The goal of this project was to learn and have an understanding of an
intro to JavaScript and jQuery.


Here is a link to the deployed version: https://sirdmu.github.io/frontend-mello/
